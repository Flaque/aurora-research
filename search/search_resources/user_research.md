## User Research

We wanted to check if our current idea of searching as the main entrance to the application made sense. First, I went ahead and 
made a small prototype to test our general design.

![Example](http://i.imgur.com/d08Qt0N.png)

I included a prompt at the top as a guide to help users know how to write a note. When the user types, the prototype will search for anything related to it in the guide. There's currently no scrolling, so searching seems a little strange.

### Questions
I went and asked people in the Hemmingson building to do 4 things for me:

1. Can you write something about a dog and create a note?
2. Can you write something about a cat and create a note?
3. Can you write something about a door and create note? 
4. Can you search for your note about the dog?

Specifically, I wanted them to create a few notes that somewhat relate to each other and then one that does not. Then, I wanted to see if they were capable of searching for a specific note.

This tested two things:
1. Can the user create a single note?
2. Can a user find a previous note?

Most users were able to create a note. However, no users were able to find a previous note by searching. Some users attempted to use hot keys like `cmd-f`, others tried to look through the top bar, but none figured out how to search. Most tried to click on the note.

However, this may have been because they had all their notes on the screen and therefore searching seems a little pointless since they could just point to their note. As such, this question will need further exploration.

## TL;DR
* Users tried to use `cmd-f` to search.
* Most users couldn't search when told
* Most users figured out how to add a note.
