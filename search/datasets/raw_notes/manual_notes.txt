how to center div: position: absolute and then top:50% and left:50% places the top edge at vertically center of the screen, and left edge at horizontally center, then by adding margin-top to negative of height of the div i.e -100 shifts it above by 100, similarly for margin-left. This gets div exactly in the center of the page.

I learned to react to change better. I learned I need to bring up issues and problems as soon as they happen rather than let them slide. I should have a higher standard of quality rather than wasting time as a result of shyness or perceived inability. I learned to accept that changes are going to happen and to try and make them happen quicker and be able to adapt better. I also learned that change is not inherently negative and can help a product become better overall. 
Modules - They should all be run with “npm start” and all should be tested with “npm test”

What’s the proper way to test plugins that rely on volley/network requests? Is there a standardized way to get robolectric and power mock to work together? 
Has anyone got instant run to work? Fixing permissions issues? How do we speed up build times?
Code should not be “owned” by any one person. Even if the senior design class wants us to say “Kyle did BLAH and Ethan did FOO” we should not maintain such ideas. Any person can edit and work on any part of the project. 
We’ll be blocked less as we don’t have to wait for “that person” who knows how to work with XYZ. For example, we faced this problem with previous projects as, in general, Ethan was the only one who worked on backend stuff and therefor the only person who knew how it worked.
1 week sprints with 1 standup and 1 retrospective/planning meeting
We all learn more and get a broader understanding of the whole system rather than just doing the same thing over and over.
We should have sprints that only last a week. More established “real” companies can have longer sprints (2, 3, or 4 week sprints) because they have several other checks in place to check in, solve blockers, and keep things working. Their programmers are generally all working full time, in an office, with several other meetings. 
we have school and all sorts of other things and can’t work on it full time. Because of that, we’re more likely to get distracted or slow down or get hit with blockers if we don’t have regular checkups. More sprints keep us honest and let us adapt to problems quicker. It also forces us to have smaller tasks that can be completed in a shorter amount of time, which works better when our day-to-day lives are so variable. 
With 1 week sprints, we should have 1 standup and 1 retrospective/planning meeting.
We don’t need a standup each day. We may only work on this an hour or two a day anyway, so filling that up with standup meetings might take up too much time. Also, there will some days where some of us can’t work at all due to a test or homework or whatever.  Therefore a standup each day is probably going to be overkill. Instead, let’s have 1 standup somewhere in the middle of the week so we can catch problems before the end of the sprint, but not take up too much time.
“I’ve seen a team of three people operate in such a way that each person published interfaces to the other two. This led to all sorts of gyrations to maintain interfaces when it would have been easier to go into the code base and make the edits. Organizations with an overly strong notion of code ownership tend to behave this way. Using published interfaces is useful, but it comes with a cost. So don’t publish interfaces unless you really need to. This may mean modifying your code ownership rules to allow people to change other people’s code in order to support an interface change.

You MUST leave the code better than you found it. If you cannot leave the code better than you found it, you MUST write a comment that says “I cannot leave the code better than I found it”, otherwise your code review will be rejected.

Many users, when asked to search, tried to press command-f. Maybe this should focus the submit editor to nudge the user towards the correct usage.
Bug: User should not be able to make an empty note
Enhancement: Command-F should focus the SubmitEditor
Enhancement: Tokenize each word in the search query
Potential Enhancement: Search only after the user stops typing
Potential Enhancement: Search should fill a “queue” of most recent items rather than flipping things around
The search should act as a stream of items and when it finds something, it should add it to the “queue” of items appearing on the feed.
Feature: Notes should be editable
Notes should be implemented as Editors, which will give both similar structure and the ability to change the notes.
Feature: Notes should be saved
There’s currently no way to persist your notes
Feature: Notes should be able to be deleted
You should be able to remove your notes from the screen and to remove them from any saves
