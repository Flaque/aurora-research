# Software testing
## Basic Overview
Software testing provides information about the quality of the software.
Test techniques usually try to run the program in a way with the intention to find bugs.
Under an agile approach programming and testing are done simultaneously.
Software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually.
Generally goes from Unit testing, to Integration testing, to System testing, to Acceptance testing.
The earlier a bug is found the cheaper it is to fix.
## Types of testing
### Static Testing
A person going through the code
### Dynamic Testing
Programmed code going through test cases
#### Types of dynamic testing
##### Unit testing
Breaks the program into pieces and tests each piece
##### Functional acceptance test
Tests the software using a given data set to make sure the program functions properly
##### User acceptance test
Similar to the functional acceptance test, but with more user like data
##### Integration test
Tests communication paths between different parts of the module
### Load testing
Measures system performance as the workload increases
### Stress testing
Measures performance outside of normal conditions
### Spike testing
Type of stress testing when workloads are spiked quickly and repeatedly
### Endurance testing
Normal workload over an extended period of time
### Scalability testing
Tests to see if the software is handling increasing workloads well
### Volume testing
Tests how well software performs with large amounts of data
## Tips on testing
* Analyze test results thoroughly
* Maximize test coverage
* Intend to find bugs
* Group test cases for regression testing
* Go beyond requirement testing
* Clarity in bug reporting
* Find the "good enough" threshold
