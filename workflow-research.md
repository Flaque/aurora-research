# Workflow Research
One of the research tasked Aurora needs to decide is how we will organize our project tasks. There are many software products available for such tasks. I'll discuss two potential options Jira and Trello.

# Project Management Software

## Jira
Jira is a software designed by Atlassian that supports both Kanban and Agile workflows. This will directly affect the way we develop our senior project. Jira will allow us to organize the development into three classes of issues Epics, Stories, and Issues. Which follows the exact Agile workflow. It also allows advancced tracking of the project

## Trello
Trello is a different kind of project management system it is based on a board system where you define tasks and place those cards in different boards. Trello does not directly support any workflows out of the box. However, Trello is much more light weight and flexible than Jira.

# Cost

## Jira 
Jira is avaliable as a perpetual server license for $10 once or a cloud hosted license for $10 a month. Hosting the Jira server itself makes the cloud license and perpetual license around the same cost.

## Trello
Trello would be free for our team to use during the developlment cycle of the senior project.
